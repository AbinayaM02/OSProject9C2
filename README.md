OSProject
=========

This is a GPU based project aimed at implementing a machine learning algorithm that can examine cancer datasets and identify multiple genetic markers that are associated with the same type of cancer, and also cases where a single genetic marker is associated with multiple types of cancers.

The implementation of backend is done using CUDA C. HTML and Javascript is used for the frontend.
